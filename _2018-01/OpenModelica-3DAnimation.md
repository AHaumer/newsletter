OpenModelica supports 3D visualization and animation in two ways

1. Built-in 3D animation and visualization in OMEdit of multi-body systems (since OpenModelica v1.11.0; see the [User's Guide](https://openmodelica.org/doc/OpenModelicaUsersGuide/v1.12.0/omedit.html#d-visualization) for instructions).
2. Visualization using third-party libraries such as the commercial DLR Visualization library.

#### Visualization in OMEdit of Multi-Body Systems

* This is a built-in feature of OMEdit to visualize and animate MSL-Multi-Body shapes
* Supports visualization and animation of simulation results
* Animation of geometric primitives and CAD-Files


#### Visualization Using the External DLR Visualization Library

The DLR visualization library supports the following:
* Advanced, model-integrated and vendor-unspecific visualization for Modelica models
* Offline, online and real-time animation
* Video-export function
* Commercial library, a feature reduced free Community Edition exists
