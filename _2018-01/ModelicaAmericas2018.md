The American Modelica Conference 2018 will be held at the Samberg Conference Center in Cambridge, MA, USA from October 9 - 10, 2018. 
It is organized by the Modelica Association and the North American Modelica User Group NAMUG.

The Modelica Conference is the main event for users, library developers, tool vendors and researchers to share their knowledge and 
learn about the latest scientific and industrial progress related to Modelica and to the Functional Mockup Interface (FMI). 
The program will cover modeling of complex physical and cyber-physical systems, as well as tools, for a wide range of research and industrial applications. All contributions are peer-reviewed and selected by the Program Committee. This conference is co-organized by NAMUG, the North American Modelica Users' Group, and the Modelica Association. 

This conference will have one or several conference tracks with presentations of peer-reviewed papers as all Modelica conferences, but it will, in addition, have one track of industrial user-oriented presentations as user meetings by NAMUG have had for the last 5 years, that does not need to be accompanied by a full scientific paper. The abstracts of the presentations will also be peer-reviewed by the conference board. 

We are looking forward to seeing you in Cambridge, MA.

Dr. Michael Tiller and Associate Professor Luigi Vanfretti, PhD

General Chair (Xogeny) and Program Chair (Rensselaer Polytechnical Institute)
