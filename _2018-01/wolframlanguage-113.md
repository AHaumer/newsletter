The system modeling functionality in the Wolfram Language makes it very easy to accomplish tasks such as:
- Analyzing problems in and the performance of systems, e.g. [vibration analysis of a printing press](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/examples/industrial-manufacturing/configuration-analysis-cylinders.html)
- Designing and optimizing aspects of a system, e.g. [design of an aircraft autopilot](https://www.wolfram.com/system-modeler/examples/aerospace-defense/aircraft-dynamics-design-simulation.html)
- Exploring and investigating different scenarios, e.g. [studying the spread of sickle cell anemia](http://blog.wolfram.com/data/uploads/2018/03/Natural-Selection-with-Wolfram-SystemModeler.nb)
