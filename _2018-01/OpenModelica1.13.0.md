OpenModelica is the most complete open-source Modelica-based cyber-physical mathematical modeling,
simulation and optimization environment intended for industrial and academic usage.
Its long-term development is supported by a non-profit organization – the Open Source Modelica Consortium [OSMC](https://www.openmodelica.org/)
with many company, institute, and university members.

The current OpenModelica development is focused on OpenModelica 1.13.0, for which a Beta1 release is planned at the beginning of April,2018.
Some of the main new items in this release are the following:

- Replaceable library GUI support.
- OMSimulator 2.0 – the second release of our efficient FMI Simulation tool including a GUI for FMI Composition and co-simulation
- Improved OpenModelica DAEMode for efficient solution of large Modelica models.
- Matlab scripting API to OpenModelica.
- Julia scripting API to OpenModelica.
- OMSysIdent - parameter estimation module for linear and non-linear parametric dynamic models.
- Interactive simulation and control of simulations with OPC-UA.
- PDEModelica1 - experimental support for one-dimensional PDEs in Modelica.
- Analytic directional derivatives for FMI export and efficient calculation of multiple Jacobian columns – giving much faster simulation for some models
- Enhanced OMEdit – including fast multi-file search
